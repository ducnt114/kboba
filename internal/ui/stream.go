// receiveBatch blocks until one value arrives on ch, then also takes every
// value that is already waiting (up to limit in total) without blocking.
//
// This is how kboba turns a channel into Bubble Tea messages: one tea.Cmd
// waits for the next batch, the Update that handles it re-subscribes with a
// new tea.Cmd. Batching means a burst (the initial pod list, a chatty log)
// costs one Update/render instead of one per item.
//
// ok is false only when ch is closed and nothing was received.
